# Broke Bot

**Broke Bot** is a lightweight Telegram bot designed to track daily expenses and log them into Google Sheets. Built on **Google Apps Script**, it provides an easy-to-use interface for managing finances directly from Telegram.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Expense Tracking**: Log expenses from Telegram messages into Google Sheets.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Automatically stores and categorizes expenses.
- **Telegram Bot Interface**: Interact with the bot to categorize and manage spending.
- **Automated Deployment**: Uses GitHub Actions to deploy code to Google Apps Script.

## üöÄ Benefits

- Stores data in a **simple format** for effortless analysis.
- **No app installation required**‚Äîjust chat with the bot.
- **Automated reminders** ensure you never forget to log expenses. Simply forward your transaction SMS messages.

## üìù Notes on Google Apps Script

- **Webhook Responses**: Google Apps Script returns `302 Found` if a response body is included, which can break Telegram webhooks. **Avoid returning unnecessary content**.
- **Authentication**: Google Apps Script does **not** support GCP service accounts for authentication.  
  - Use a **user token** instead, refresh it manually, and update GitHub Secrets for CI/CD.
- **CLI (`clasp`)**:  
  - `clasp login` stores authentication in `~/.clasprc.json`.  
  - **Heads-up**: `clasp run` expects `.clasprc.json` inside the project directory‚Äîcopy it manually.
- **Deployments**:  
  - **HEAD deployments**: Latest pushed code, can be used for testing.
  - **Versioned deployments**: Used for production stability.  
  - **Deployment Limit**: Only **20 versions** can exist at a time‚Äîremove older ones regularly (automated via GitHub Actions).
